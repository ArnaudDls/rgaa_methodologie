# RGAA 3 Testing Methodology

*This resource is also [available online](http://disic.github.io/rgaa_methodologie/en/), without requiring to download this repository.*

This document has been written as part of the resources that support the application of RGAA (General Framework for Accessibility for the French Administrations), version 3 2016.

It is aimed at any person willing to check conformance of web content as per the RGAA&nbsp;3. It is a testing methodology, documenting the steps needed to check whether or not a criterion of the RGAA&nbsp;3&nbsp;2016 is conforming. This methodology must therefore be used **in addition** with the [technical reference](https://disic.github.io/rgaa_referentiel_en/criteria.html), and can not be used alone.

For each criterion or test, at least two methods are proposed, one for Internet Explorer, and one for Firefox. These browsers are also mentioned in the [reference baseline](https://disic.github.io/rgaa_referentiel_en/baseline.html) for screenreaders testing.

The proposed methods are not the only possible ones, some of the criteria or tests can be checked with other browsers. A restricted choice has been made, in order to minimize the document's length and ease its understanding.

Because none should need to acquire expensive special software to comply with the law, each tool proposed to perform the tests has been chosen for three reasons:

* reliability of the results, and frequent use by subject matter experts;
* ease of use and of results management, sparing the need for complex software set up;
* free of charge, and whenever possible, not requiring the purchase of a licence.

Other tools exist, anyone is free to test and use them.

**Please note that this methodology is a companion document, aiming at helping with the application of the RGAA&nbsp;3&nbsp;2016 technical reference. It should not prevent you from carefully reading the technical reference, nor getting RGAA training.**
